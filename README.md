This repository contains course project for the Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data.' 

Repository contents:

- run_analysis.R -- a commented R script that fulfills the functions of the assignment
  - reading data
  - merging data
  - renaming/transforming as necessary
  - extracts means and std deviations of all data columns (returns to console)
  - writes the required tidy data output file
  - writes the required tidy column means file (note I use comma separators, I like to view files in Excel)
  
  To execute the code:
  
  - in your working directory, have the run_analysis R script and all required input files.
  - execute the R script
  - the column means and std deviations will be printed in the R console (R Studio, in my case)
  - the required output files will be created in the working directory
